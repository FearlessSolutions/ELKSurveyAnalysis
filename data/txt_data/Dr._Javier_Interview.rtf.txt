How do patients currently keep track of skin changes? For example, my grandmother is part of a clinical trial that asks her to keep a written diary.
- for patients that are at-risk, self-skin exam once a month when their fully undressed, say after the shower. becoming familiar with their skin, like learning the constellations in the sky. Pay attention to see if over time, they notice new spots.
- some who are more savvy take pictures of moles and put little stickers with dates on them. They then accumulate a photo gallery.
- some take them with polaroids and bring in a box.
- about 10% of the patients bring in photos, <5% bring in multiple photos### invalid font number 1


### invalid font number 0
Are there any pain points in tracking your patients skin changes?
- as long as the pictures are clear, and not fuzzy. If they can identify where the mole is because sometimes the photos are taken so close up that you cant tell where the mole is. Its better when the patients are state exactly where the mole is located on the body (upper left arm).
- its painful when their bad photographs when their blurry and you cant tell where their from but thats not too often.### invalid font number 1

What would be helpful to you as a physician  in tracking your patients skin changes?### invalid font number 1

- using technology, an easier way to consolidate photographs to electronic charts so its in-sync and fluid. Right now its a little clunky because the photographic system we have is on a different server and you have to flip flop between systems. If the system was more unified and fast it would make it easier to track these things.

Have you ever heard of value-based care, or participate in any value-based care programs?### invalid font number 1

- Ive heard it loosely thrown around. It applies to insurance providers that are outside of Kaiser. Kaiser is all-centered around value-based care.
- The way the physicians practice, and the model, is not exactly the same as other insurance providers.
