Where would you go to learn about Melanoma?
- Probably my dermatologist

Do you know about the risk factors of Melanoma, such as tanning, or over exposure to the sun?
- a few

How do you currently find out about Melanoma?
- an online search first, I usually go to google scholar, and then also my dermatologist (Dr. Donald Frisbee)

Do you think an educational app would be helpful?

How do you currently keep track of skin changes?

Would it be helpful to you to have an app that provided you with a list of dermatologists that focused on your type of skin?
