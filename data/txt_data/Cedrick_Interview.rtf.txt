Do you have a dermatologist?
- yes but only been once

What do you do if you have a skin issue?
- usually I resort to home remedies

Do you have any moles or other skin conditions that have ever caused you concern?
- no

Have you ever heard of Melanoma?
- yes, only from commercials, nothing that I actively investigate

Have you ever known someone with Melanoma?
- no

Where would you go to learn about Melanoma?
- I got webmd, and another one that comes up from a basic google search. I think, healthline

Do you know about the risk factors of Melanoma, such as tanning, or over exposure to the sun?
- no

How do you currently find out about Melanoma?
- Id go to webmd or other respectable scholarly sources like the NIH or other peer-reviewed articles.

Do you think an educational app would be helpful?
- I dont think an app would be as beneficial as youtube. People search youtube much more fervently. If someone goes on youtube and types, #melanoma is much easier for people to do than to go to an app store and download an app, something they probably wouldnt do.

How do you currently keep track of skin changes?
- just visuals, watch, if you see something out of the ordinary then I track it for about a week or so. Ill then go to the dermatologist as a follow-up consultation to confirm its gone or not.

Do you think it would be beneficial for you to use an app or imaging device to track changes?
- no, because when you get into apps you get into privacy concerns. So when youre talking about physical changes people are less inclined to use an app.

Would it be helpful to you to have an app that provided you with a list of dermatologists that focused on your type of skin?
- no, because Im not an app person

How would you find this app?
- if I did search, then Id use the google play store

Do you have anyone in your life who could help you do a skin check? Back of your head? Back?
- yes

If so, what is there relationship?
- family and friends

Is it okay to follow up with you?
- yes, cedric.harriott@gmail.com
