Do you have a dermatologist?
- Yes

What do you do if you have a skin issue?
- I try to treat it naturally first, try not to put chemicals on my face. I live in sunscreen.

Do you have any moles or other skin conditions that have ever caused you concern?
- yes

Have you ever known someone with, or heard of Melanoma?
Yes, Ive had several students who Ive encouraged to go get checked and they did have it.

Where would you go to learn about Melanoma?
- today the internet but when I was teaching, peer reviews and anything that came from NIH or Mayo Clinic

Do you know about the risk factors of Melanoma, such as tanning, or over exposure to the sun?
- yes, even UV lighting is an issue, which is why I use sunscreen (even sesame oil is a natural sunscreen)

How do you currently find out about Melanoma?
- the internet

Do you think an educational app would be helpful?
- only if it included the ability to scan it and compare it to something, kids want an immediate fix, if you could scan your skin then ask the app should you go get this checked, then yes.

How do you currently keep track of skin changes?
- I do a lot of self skin care. I have a mole that I want taken off but my dermatologist said no. They said they didnt want to stimulate cancer cells.

Do you think it would be beneficial for you to use an app or imaging device to track changes?
- yes, absolutely because were moving that way anyway. Meaning, having an android assess you, triage you before actually see a physician.

Would it be helpful to you to have an app that provided you with a list of dermatologists that focused on your type of skin?
- yes, and convenient to where you are. And to connect you with your health plan to let you know if its in network or out of network.

How would you find this app?
- probably from my medical provider, my medical insurance gives me $75 to keep up with my mammograms

Do you have anyone in your life who could help you do a skin check? Back of your head? Back?
- yes

If so, what is there relationship?
- daughter

Is it okay to follow up with you?
- yes, jpressey07@gmail.com
