Do you think it would be beneficial for you to use an app or imaging device to track changes?

Would it be helpful to you to have an app that provided you with a list of dermatologists that focused on your type of skin?
- yes because it took me a while to find a black dermatologist. Not that other kinds of dermatologist wouldnt know black skin but I feel like a black dermatologist would be more likely to understand it and our sensitivities like not recommending cremes that lighten skin. It would also help to be able to find a second opinion.
